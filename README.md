# jasmine_randhawa_activity15
This is the for assignment 15, where I'll create a repository to learn how GitHub works.

The plan is to:
- Create a dev branch and make meaningful commits
- Create a README file that explains the project
- Learn how to link commits to issues and how to close them
- Make pull requests and merge into the main branch

This will feature data that about baby names popularity and the US military enlistment.  The data for the popularity of baby names came from dcData's BabyNames dataset, and the data about US military enlistment came from: https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/19xQnI1cBh6Jkw7eP8YQuuicMlVDF7Gr-nXCb5qbwb_E/edit?gid=597536282#gid=597536282.  
The project will also look at the box problem and there was no dataset was used when analyzing it.

This repo includes:
- A README file
- A qmd file
- A pdf file
- A planning document

This repo will also include a main branch, a developer branch, commits, issues, and pull requests.
