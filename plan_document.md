# Project and Repository Planning Document

## Project Plan
### Goals:
- Create a repository that follows the assignment requirements
- Show understanding of how GitHub works by properly using branches, commits, issues, and pull requests

### Needs:
- A main branch and a dev branch
- Multiple commits that follows the assignment's commit form
- Issues that are properly tagged, have commits linked, and are closed
- A README that explains the project
- A planning document that goes over how the student will do the assignment

### Steps:
1.  Create a dev branch from main
2.  Create a README file that follows the assignments instructions
3.  Create a planning file that will detail all of the steps
4.  Add in the project files (qmd and pdf)
5.  Write clear commit messages that follow 'If applied, the commit will...'
6.  Create issues and link commits to issues
7.  Open pull requests and merge from the dev branch to the main branch

## Repository Set Up and Maintenance:
### Goals:
- Create and maintain an organized repository
- Make sure that main stays updated

### Needs:
- Properly committing files
- Using issues and closing them when resolved
- Pull requests turn into merges

### Steps:
1.  Work primarily in the dev branch, then merge to main
2.  Each task will have an issue that corresponds to it, issues will be closed when they are completed
3.  Commits will follow the same style
4.  Pull requests should entail what will be changing when the dev branches merges back into the main branch
5.  The main branch will stay up to date
